const e=`title: REMOTE DETONATION
trigger: If the player has a survivor at the colony, and that survivor takes a
  build barricade action
context: >-
  Setting up barricades sucks. Not only is the work hard, but you have to carry
  the Pole, a 10 foot long metal post with a sharpened end, used to push back
  the crowding dead. Last week, someone painted a flag on it, which you'd guess
  is the national flag of Poland. Is there even a Poland anymore? The Pole is
  unwieldy but useful in times like this. You jab into a zombie that gets too
  close to your work area. 

  "What the?" %% The zombie has another wound in its gut, and from out of the wound you see a blinking red light. You spot another corpse staggering towards you, a light in its belly as well. Looks like the bandits found some serious gear. You give one last shove with the Pole before turning to run.
result: Remove all zombies from the colony. Remove all barricades from the
  colony. If more zombies were removed than barricades, place 1 wound token on
  all survivors at the colony.
