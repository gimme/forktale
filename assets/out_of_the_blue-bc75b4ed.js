const e=`title: OUT OF THE BLUE
trigger: If the player has a survivor who performs a search at the grocery
  store, and Blue is still in the survivor deck
context: Look at Barry stealing food. Stupid Barry reason no bananas in stupid
  place. Barry take bananas and leave Blue to go eat poop. Blue no want poop.
  Blue no like tummy full of ouchies. Maybe Barry should eat the poop.  You spot
  an elderly woman in the store, scrounging for supplies the same as yourself.
  You raise your hand in a cautious greeting, but the old woman gasps and looks
  above your head.  "I don't want to alarm you," she says slowly. "But there's
  an angry chimpanzee trying to poop on your head."
result: Search the survivor deck for Blue and add her to the following of any
  other player. Equip this card on 1 of your survivors at the grocery store.
  This survivor is now "Barry." If at any point Blue and Barry are the only
  survivors at a location, the player controlling Barry must place a card from
  his hand into the waste pile, or receive 1 despair token. If Blue dies, remove
  all despair tokens from Barry.
