trigger: If Elijah is in play and is not exiled
context: '"Jazz, hip hop, rock and roll. . . What kind of music do zombies
  like?" Elijah leafs through the albums before stopping on one featuring a man
  in a white suit, lying on his side. "Oh man, this is too perfect. Ironic pop
  of the 80s it is!" He pulls the record out of its dusty jacket and places it
  on the spindle. Elijah glances at the tower of speakers, and checks to make
  sure they''re wired correctly. Satisfied, he powers up the generator. "Okay
  Michael," he whispers. "Help us out." He lets the needle drop before taking
  off in a sprint.'
result: Elijah's sound setup at the old movie theater draws the attention of the
  dead. This card remains in play. As long as this card is in play, when
  flipping for noise, roll a die instead and only add a zombie on a die result
  of 1. At the beginning of each round, 1 player must place a fuel card into the
  waste pile to keep the generator running. If a fuel card is not spent in this
  way, discard this card.
