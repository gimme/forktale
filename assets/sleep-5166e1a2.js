trigger: If a player other than the player reading this card yawns
context: God, you're tired.  Anxiety kept you tossing and turning last night,
  and now you feel like you're passing through the day in a fog.  You consider
  playing sick so you can turn in early, and really it isn't a bad idea.  You've
  been making bad decisions all day and could genuinely use the rest.
result: Until the end of this round, at the beginning of each player's turn,
  they may choose to move all their action dice from their unused action dice
  pool to their used action dice pool to remove 1 wound from each survivor they
  control.
