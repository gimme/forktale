const e=`title: JANET TAYLOR
trigger: If the player controls Janet and she is not exiled
context: '"We should be more concerned about treating minor wounds.  Not only
  do we know next to nothing about the plague that made the zombies, but even
  things like small infections could prove problematic to treat.  Besides, no
  one wants to be wounded during a survival situation.  I can set up a clinic,
  but I''m going to need everyone else to keep me well supplied."'
result: For the remainder of the game, if Janet is also in the colony, during a
  player's turn that player may place a card from their hand into the waste pile
  without using its ability to remove 1 wound from a survivor they control at
  the colony.
