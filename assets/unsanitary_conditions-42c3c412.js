const o=`title: UNSANITARY CONDITIONS
trigger: If the player controls 1 or more wounded survivors and there are 5 or
  more cards in the waste pile
context: You can feel the heat coming from your throbbing wound. The slightest
  press of your index finger produces a foul colored pus and a pain that can't
  be ignored. You suppose infection was inevitable - there are no showers, no
  running water, and the soap ran out a week ago. And you're not the only one
  like this. Antibiotics are a precious resource now, so everyone's hoping to
  shake off infections naturally. But a glance at your wound tells you all you
  need to know. If you don't get treated soon, you could die.
result: You may place 1 medicine card into the waste pile to remove all wounds
  from a survivor you control. You may do this multiple times. After doing so,
  if you still control any survivors with wound tokens on them, place 1
  additional wound token on those survivors.
