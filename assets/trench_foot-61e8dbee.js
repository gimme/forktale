trigger: If the trench improvement is in play
context: >-
  "Trench is filling up," you say, and your friend nods. You stand there
  listening to the surreal sound of dozens of bodies scrabbling at the earthen
  walls that trap them. But even more surreal than the noise is how used to it
  you are. 

  "Much longer, and they'll be climbing up on us," she replies. "We should torch them." %% "Probably," you admit, "But I don't want to know what that will smell like." %% "Pork," your friend whispers, and she looks at you with sad eyes that know too much. "Burning humans smell like pork."
result: Burn the trench. Any player may choose to burn the trench. If a player
  chooses to burn the trench that player must roll exposure on each survivor
  they control and add a card to the waste pile without using its effect. If no
  player burns the trench, add 6 zombies to the colony.
