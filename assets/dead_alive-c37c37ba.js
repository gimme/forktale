const e=`title: DEAD ALIVE
trigger: If the player controls a survivor at a non-colony location, and there
  is at least 1 dead survivor in the graveyard
context: '"It''s like I just saw a ghost. You ever have a time, where you were
  in the downtown of some city, and you''d see someone who, for just a second,
  reminded you of someone you used to know? And you knew it wasn''t them, but
  just for a second you thought maybe it was? I feel like that all the time now.
  I''ll see some dead face and it will remind me of someone, and just for a
  second, I''m afraid it''s them. Like just now. I saw a zombie over there that
  looked like you-know-who. Do you see? It''s that one over there. Doesn''t it
  look just like. . . oh. Oh God. Oh no, no, no."'
result: Roll a die, and take that many dead survivors from the graveyard. Place
  1 in a zombie space at the same non- colony location as 1 of the player's
  survivors. Place the rest at random locations in zombie spaces. These dead
  survivors are zombie-survivors and follow all the rules for zombies. Any time
  a survivor ends its turn sharing a location with a zombie-survivor, place 1
  despair token on that survivor. When removing zombies from a location, a
  player may choose to remove a zombie-survivor from that location instead of a
  normal zombie.
