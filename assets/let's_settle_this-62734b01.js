const e=`title: LET'S SETTLE THIS
trigger: If any player other than you accuses another player (even you) of being
  a betrayer or traitor, but does not call for an exile vote
context: '"That''s it!" he screams, throwing down his tools.  "I''ve had it up
  to here with your crap! You''re always questioning my every motive when all I
  do is work my butt off for this place.  What is it you do here other than talk
  big? Well, screw this.  Everybody gather ''round.  We''re settling this here and
  now!"'
result: An exile vote is immediately held for the "accused" player.  Treat this
  like any other exile vote. If the vote does not pass, place this card in front
  of the accused player.  From now on, anyone wishing to call for an exile vote
  against that player must spend an action die of any result to do so.
