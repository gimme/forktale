const e=`title: I AIN'T DEAD YET
trigger: If the player performs a search and at least three survivors have been killed
context: You fall on your side, your left arm pinned awkwardly underneath
  you.  You scream at the explosion of pain from your elbow, but the dead child
  that ambushed you does not care.  It crawls up your body, groans escaping its
  crusty mouth.  You pull your arm free, but it is too late - the snapping jaws
  descend to your exposed flesh.  But suddenly the zombie's head bursts open,
  splattering you in fetid fluid and corrupted flesh. Your rescuer stands above
  you and offers a hand up. You gasp. "You? But how? We thought you were I mean
  I saw you die!"
result: Choose a survivor that was killed and removed from the game.  Add it to
  your following and place its standee at the colony.  Gain 1 morale.
