trigger: If a survivor the player controls is at the gas station
context: How did you not see the newspaper display by the door before? There it
  is, splashed all over the front page. Raxxon Pharmaceuticals. Scandal.
  Government investigation. And there on the faded newsprint is a picture of a
  person you recognize. A person in your colony.
result: Choose a player and look at that player's secret objective. If the
  secret objective is a betrayal objective you must immediately reveal it. The
  betrayer is immediately exiled. "Apparently some whistle blower told
  authorities that Raxxon was developing biological weapons," you tell the
  others. "Well our friend here was a director at Raxxon, and under
  investigation by the feds. And as we all know, it was right when the feds
  raided Raxxon that everything went to hell." If the secret objective is not a
  betrayal objective do not reveal it and announce to the group that the player
  is not a betrayer. "Did you know there is a hero living in our midst? They
  were a contractor working at Raxxon who saw too much. Pity their warnings came
  too late."
