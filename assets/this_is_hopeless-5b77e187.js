trigger: If morale is 2 or lower
context: '"Guys, it''s been real. Real shitty to be precise. If ya''ll want to
  stay and watch this boat sink, that''s your business. But us, we aren''t
  sticking around. I''d wish you the best, but let''s be honest - you poor
  bastards are screwed."'
result: Players who have completed all parts of their secret objective except
  for 'complete the main objective' may reveal their secret objective and leave
  the game. They must roll for exposure on each of their survivors 5 times (bite
  effects do not spread). If a player has any survivors remaining after rolling
  those exposures that player is considered to be a winner. If a player has no
  survivors remaining after rolling that player is considered to be a loser.
  Either way the game continues without those players.
